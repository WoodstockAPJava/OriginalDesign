This is a beginner's assignment. You are not expected to have any special knowledge or java skills to complete the assignment, and the assignment is not testing anything. Don't stress. Just tinker with the provided sample code. The purpose of the assignment is to get your mind back into thinking about Java again, and to help your instructor see what level of tinkering you are comfortable with. Have fun and be creative.

To submit your assignment, email the .java file to your instructor.
